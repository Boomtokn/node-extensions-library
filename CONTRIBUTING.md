# Contributing to Tenderly Node Extensions Library

We welcome contributions to our public GitHub repository, which contains Node Extension examples and extension starter
code. By contributing to our open-source community library, you can help others learn from your work and potentially
inspire new use cases. Additionally, it becomes easier to share extensions among different projects and protocols,
making integrations and composition easier.

Read our [documentation](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-gateway/node-extensions) to get started with Tenderly Node
Extensions.

## How to Contribute

To contribute to our repository, simply open a pull request with your node extension source code and a detailed
description of its use case. We encourage you to include any relevant information or resources that can help others
understand and use your node extension. This can include documentation, diagrams, or even video tutorials.

Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, your node extension will be added to our repository and made available
for others to use and build upon. You will also be credited as the author of the node extension, which can help you
build your reputation within the community.
