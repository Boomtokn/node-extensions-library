# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by
sending an email to **support@tenderly.co**.

Do not create a GitHub issue to report the vulnerability. We will assess the vulnerability and take appropriate steps to
address it. If necessary, we will provide updates on the process and any relevant details through the same email
conversation.

We appreciate your assistance in keeping our project safe and secure.
